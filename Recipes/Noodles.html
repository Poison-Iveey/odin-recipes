<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Noodles are one thing on a menu I very rarely will pass up! I love a good saucy, flavourful noodle recipe thatâ€™s 
    also quick and easy to make at home. These noodles encompass all that and more, they are simply a great meal to 
    make for lunch, dinner or even a midnight snack!
    The ingredients are simple for this recipe, noodles and a really easy garlicky sweet soy sauce. Combine the two,
    give a good toss and noodles are ready to be served
    Garlic Chili Oil Noodles are one of the quickest, most insanely delicious ramen noodle recipes, tossed in a spicy
    garlic chili oil sauce and ready in less than 15-minutes! With a garnish of sliced green onions and sesame seeds, 
    these garlicky noodles will definitely be in the number one spot for a quick and easy meal!
