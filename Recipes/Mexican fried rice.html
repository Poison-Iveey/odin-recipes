    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        
This Mexican Fried Rice Recipe is a delicious twist on the traditional Mexican rice that is cooked in a saucy liquid. 
Traditional Mexican rice is delicious, but we love the texture that cooking it fried rice style gives it.
This Mexican fried rice recipe is also a great way to quickly make a side dish using precooked rice from a batch cooking session or leftover rice.
The key to making great fried rice is using cooked, cold rice. When I make any type of fried rice recipe,  I like to batch cook rice the day before 
and refrigerate it overnight so it gets nice and cold. Cooked rice also freezes well if you wanted to make a larger batch and freeze it in the 
amounts you need for this and other rice recipes.

        <li>2 1/2 cups COOKED AND COOLED jasmine rice (or brown rice)</li>

        <li>fresh chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>pinch of sea salt & pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken breast with the seasonings and set aside.</li>
        <li>Set a nonstick wok on medium heat. Once hot, spray with avocado oil then add the eggs. 
            Quickly scramble and chop them up, then remove from the skillet, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to HIGH. Once hot, add the oil and then the chopped tortilla chips.
            Cook for about 1 – 2 minutes until the pieces become crispy. 
            Remove the pieces from the skillet and reduce the heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Once the skillet has cooled down to medium heat, add garlic, onion and bell pepper. 
            Saute for 3 – 5 minutes until the edges of the onion have browned and the onions 
            turn translucent. Increase heat back to high.</li>
        <li>Add the diced chicken and cook. Continually stir and cook the chicken through,
            about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the frozen corn and continue to stir and fold everything together. 
            Add the enchilada sauce and continuing stirring.
            Cook and stir until the majority of the sauce has coated the ingredients
            and the excess has “evaporated.”</li>
        <li>Add the rice (and fresh cilantro) and quickly fold everything together,
            about 2 minutes, then remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Garnish and top with fried chips, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
