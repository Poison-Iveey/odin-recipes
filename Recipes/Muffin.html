    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This muffin is the one to go to for a well-behaved, consistent recipe. 
        It does very well with any kind of berry. The batter will also keep, 
        once mixed, for up to a week in the refrigerator. It's nice to wake up, 
        turn on the oven, make your morning coffee, scoop two muffins, pop them 
        in to cook, and by the time you've fetched the paper and let the dog back 
        in, you're ready to settle down for a wonderful, warm, fresh-baked treat.
        These blueberry muffins are perfect for when you want a sweet treat but 
        don't want to spend a ton of time baking. And they make a great snack on 
        the go for those busy days!
